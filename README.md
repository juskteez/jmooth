_smooth scroll experiment with javascript_
##

Wanted to build something for my own, exspecially scrolling experience. I've been working on a few website and and found it'd be a better experience with smoothscroll so I started to learn javascript and this is what I want to do first.

#### current basic features:

 * smooth scroll vertical & horizontal with css3 transform
 * scrolling progress
 * scroll bar
 * scroll with wheel and arrow keys
 * scroll by dragging scrollbar
 * scroll by dragging the page
 * scroll by swipe (touch screen)
 * callback functions (after load, before scroll, after scroll)


**future features/improvement:**
1. scroll smoothly while holding arrow keys
2. controller interface
3. bounce edges
4. â€¦

_feel free to suggest any feature_

Looking forward to develop this as a plugin!
