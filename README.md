_smooth scroll experiment with javascript_
##

Wanted to build something for my own, exspecially scrolling experience. I've been working on a few website and and found it'd be a better experience with smoothscroll so I started to learn javascript and this is what I want to do first.

#### current basic features:

 * smooth scroll vertical & horizontal with css3 transform
 * scrolling progress
 * scroll bar
 * scroll with wheel and arrow keys
 * scroll by dragging scrollbar
 * scroll by dragging the page


**Future features/improvement:**
1. smooth scroll while holding arrow keys
2. scroll on touch device

_feel free to suggest any feature_

##

Looking forward to develop this as a plugin!
